<objective>
A claimed handoff session — or, under `spx/local/coordination.md`, a claimed Change — loaded, reconciled against current repository state, and marked with canonical pickup markers, ready to continue prior work without repeating earlier mistakes.
</objective>

<essential_principles>

- The pickup workflow opens session responsibility and NEVER releases, archives, deletes, or closes a session — a claimed session remains Claude's responsibility until a later `/handoff` accounts for it explicitly. An operator's explicit `spx session release <id>` request is a direct session-management operation outside `/pickup`. The single session exception inside pickup is the legacy-file archive `<change_coordination>` authorizes after the Change carrying that file as received input reaches a verified Claimed state. A Change is not a session: under the overlay, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/change.md` invokes `/handoff` to release a Change through Handoff, assignee removal, Status `Available`, and complete readback when an Executable Frame fails validation against current truth.
- NEVER propose fixing bugs, writing code, or any implementation work before `/contextualize` has been invoked on the target node.
- Before asking the operator to continue, review the loaded session evidence and present a no-surprises proposal: expected outcome, changed product surface, skill path, evidence infrastructure, verification plan, inspection references, and remaining-work expectation.
- If session evidence shows another active context already owns the objective, report the owning session, branch, or PR and stop without archiving, releasing, handing off, or otherwise mutating the claimed session.

</essential_principles>

<change_coordination>

When `spx/local/coordination.md` exists at the repository root, the repository coordinates work through Changes and Handoffs — GitHub issues in the store that overlay names — and this skill follows `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/change.md` in place of `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/pickup.md` and the `<claim>` procedure below. A legacy queue file claimed under that overlay becomes an unassigned Proposed, Available Change carrying the whole file as received input, then follows the normal claim transition and is archived only after the complete Claimed state verifies; that archive is the one session mutation this skill performs, and only there. `<claimed_sessions>` keeps governing any `<CLAIMED_SESSIONS>` marker already present in the conversation. Without the overlay, everything below applies unchanged.

</change_coordination>

<intake>

Preserve `$ARGUMENTS` as the requested Change reference, session id, listing
request, or automatic-selection request. Check whether
`spx/local/coordination.md` exists at the repository root without reading any
other overlay. The overlay's presence deterministically selects the Change
workflow; its absence selects the session workflow. This routing decision needs
no operator question.

<claimed_sessions>
Three rules govern a conversation's claimed-session set:

1. **The claimed-session set grows only by user confirmation.** A session joins the set when the user instructs Claude via `/pickup`, or when the user confirms a suggested pickup. Nothing else adds to it.

2. **Closure has acceptable end states only through `/handoff`.** Every claimed session becomes Claude's sole responsibility. Reflect, persist remaining validated relevant context, and end with zero, one, or several session files — one canonical continuation per independent continuation thread in the resolved claimed-session set. Supplemental or sidecar handoffs for the same thread are never valid at closure.

3. **Quick-exit shortcut.** If, within a few turns of pickup, Claude realizes the pickup was wrong, the user has two options — only the user can choose:
   - Invoke `/handoff --no-session` to archive the wrongly-claimed session immediately. The session leaves the claimed-session set but is archived, not returned to the todo queue.
   - Exit `/pickup` and directly request `spx session release <id>` as session management to move the session from `doing/` back to `todo/` for another context to claim.

   Neither action counts toward the closure workload for the claimed-session set — the wrongly-claimed session leaves the set the moment the user confirms the quick exit.

**Consequences of the three rules:**

- Every successful `spx session pickup` adds that session id to the CLAIMED_SESSIONS marker for this conversation. A later pickup does not replace earlier entries — the set is additive.
- The pickup workflow MUST NOT archive, release, delete, or manually move any session, except the legacy-file archive `<change_coordination>` authorizes after its Change exists; a Change release is not a session mutation, per `<essential_principles>`. After the post-context checkpoint, leave the claimed session in `doing`; an explicit direct release request exits this workflow before session management executes it.
- A newly created handoff session is a workflow artifact, not a substitute for the claimed session. Its existence never grants permission to close any claimed session.
- Queue inspection alone is never permission. Archival comes from completing the handoff workflow against the claimed-session set named in CLAIMED_SESSIONS.

</claimed_sessions>

<session_management>
All session management uses `spx session` CLI commands:

```bash
# List sessions in status `todo`
spx session todo [--json]

# List sessions by status (includes `todo` and `doing` by default)
spx session list [--status todo|doing|archive] [--json]

# Claim one or more sessions (move todo -> doing)
spx session pickup [ids...] [--auto]

# Show session content
spx session show <id...>

# Return claimed sessions to the todo queue (move doing -> todo)
spx session release [ids...]

# Create a handoff session (JSON header + body on stdin)
spx session handoff

# Move sessions to archive
spx session archive <id...>
```

Sessions are organized in `.spx/sessions/` in the **root worktree** (gitignored, sibling to `.git`):

```
.spx/sessions/
├── todo/      # Available for pickup
├── doing/     # Currently claimed
└── archive/   # Completed
```

Session IDs use format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`. If the user message or `$ARGUMENTS` includes a token in this format (or with a trailing `.md` suffix as in `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md`), treat that token as the session identifier and act on it with `spx session show <id>` or `spx session pickup <id>` before validating any accompanying cache paths or markdown link targets. Priority order: `high` > `medium` > `low` (oldest first within same priority). The CLI handles atomic operations — NEVER touch session files manually except to read them. Multiple Claude sessions can run `/pickup` simultaneously; the CLI prevents race conditions.

</session_management>

<claim>
This whole section is skipped when `spx/local/coordination.md` exists — `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/change.md` then owns claiming, per `<change_coordination>`.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--list`:**

1. Get all todo sessions:
   ```bash
   spx session todo --json
   ```
2. Parse each session to extract session ID, `priority`, `goal`, `next_step`, and `git_ref` from frontmatter, plus nodes from the `<nodes>` section. Limit to most recent 10.
3. Present one single-select question with `AskUserQuestion`:
   - Stable question id when the runtime schema exposes one: `handoff`
   - Header: `Handoff`
   - Question: `Which handoff would you like to load?`
   - Options: 2-3 mutually exclusive sessions, each labeled with its full session id, priority, and branch context and described by its goal and next step
4. Claim the chosen session:
   ```bash
   spx session pickup <selected-session-id>
   ```

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a session id:** Strip an optional trailing `.md` suffix and claim that exact session:

```bash
spx session pickup <session-id>
```

**Otherwise (default):** Claim the highest priority (or oldest if tied) session:

```bash
spx session pickup --auto
```

The CLI selects by priority, moves `todo/` → `doing/` atomically, outputs the `<PICKUP_ID>...</PICKUP_ID>` marker, and displays the claimed session content.

Parse the claimed session id from `<PICKUP_ID>` and immediately emit the canonical claim marker:

```text
<PICKUP_CLAIM id="[claimed-session-id]">
claimed
</PICKUP_CLAIM>
```

Then emit (or extend) the running CLAIMED_SESSIONS marker. Scan the conversation for the most recent `<CLAIMED_SESSIONS ids="...">` marker:

- **No prior CLAIMED_SESSIONS marker** → emit `<CLAIMED_SESSIONS ids="[claimed-session-id]">`.
- **Prior CLAIMED_SESSIONS marker exists** → emit a new marker whose `ids` attribute is the prior list with `[claimed-session-id]` appended (comma-separated, order preserved).

```text
<CLAIMED_SESSIONS ids="[first-pickup],[second-pickup],...,[claimed-session-id]">
the claimed sessions this conversation must close
</CLAIMED_SESSIONS>
```

The CLAIMED_SESSIONS marker names every in-conversation pickup that Claude is responsible for closing. Handoff workflows read the MOST RECENT `<CLAIMED_SESSIONS>` to determine which sessions to archive at closure. If multiple pickups happen in one conversation, later steps MUST key off this set, not a single-session marker.

Use the `id` attribute on `<PICKUP_CLAIM>` as the canonical identifier for the current pickup (checkpoints, markers, error messages).

Once claimed, follow `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/pickup.md` to process the session.

The workflow invokes `/understand` immediately before its first product-content access — the coordination-note path check under `spx/` when the session names a node, otherwise the `/contextualize` invocation for the node the operator names — and at no earlier step; the claim, `spx session show`, checkout, base sync, and claim reconciliation touch no product content and need no reload. Node-local `PLAN.md` and `ISSUES.md` content is read by `/contextualize`, not by pre-context pickup steps.

</claim>

<error_handling>
**No sessions directory or empty**:

```
No handoff sessions found in .spx/sessions/todo/
Use `/handoff` to create a handoff document.
```

**Only doing sessions exist**:

```
Found only doing sessions — these are claimed by active Claude sessions.
```

Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:

- Wait for other sessions to complete
- Check if doing sessions are orphaned (from abandoned sessions)

**Invalid session format**:

```
Warning: Session [id] appears to be corrupted or incomplete.
Showing raw content:
[show file content via spx session show <id>]
```

**Change store unreachable or unauthenticated** (`spx/local/coordination.md` present):

```
gh could not reach <store>: <gh error>
Authenticate gh (project scope) or fix the overlay; no Change was claimed or created.
```

**Overlay incomplete**: `spx/local/coordination.md` names no store repository, project owner and number, or Product value — report the missing value and stop; never guess a store.

**Change closed, non-Available, held elsewhere, or another Product's**: `owned_elsewhere` — report the terminal state, Status, current holder, winning `Claim:` session id, or mismatched Product and stop without mutation.

**Change transition interrupted**: when any required issue, project-item, Product, Maturity, Status, assignee, Claim, Handoff, or readback operation fails, report the completed writes in order, the failed operation, and the complete observed state; stop before every later mutation. A legacy file stays in `doing` unarchived until its Change reaches a verified Claimed state.

**Archive failed after the Change exists**: `spx session archive <id>` is retried once; on a second failure the created issue URL is reported beside the file id and the file stays in `doing`; the next pickup of that file finds the issue through the store search and resumes it rather than creating another.

**Several Changes match a legacy file**: the store search finds more than one Change carrying the file as received input — classify `needs_operator_direction`, report every match, create nothing, and leave the file in `doing`.

**Secret detected in legacy file**: report the file id and the kind of content found (never the value); the file stays in `doing` and no Change is created until the operator redacts it — after which the file is re-read and re-inspected — or abandons the migration.

</error_handling>

<failure_modes>

**Failure 1: Claude resumed implementation immediately after `/contextualize`**

Claude loaded `/contextualize`, then invoked `/apply` or started writing ADRs, tests, or code without a user checkpoint. The pre-context gate passed, but the workflow left the post-context transition as a suggestion instead of a requirement.

How to avoid: After `/contextualize`, present the loaded state and stop. Use `AskUserQuestion` unless `$ARGUMENTS` explicitly includes `--auto-continue`. Do not invoke `/apply` or edit files before that checkpoint completes.

**Failure 2: Claude orphaned earlier pickups by archiving only the most recent doing session at handoff**

Claude picked up more than one session in the same conversation. The later handoff workflow archived only the most recent pickup, leaving earlier in-conversation pickups stranded in `doing/`. The next Claude context then had to read multiple handoff files to reconstruct the continuation.

How to avoid: Emit (or extend) `<CLAIMED_SESSIONS ids="...">` on every pickup so the latest marker names the full claimed-session set. Handoff workflow 04 reads the set and archives every id. Closure writes one canonical continuation per independent thread — never a sidecar for the same thread.

**Failure 3: Claude treated the existence of a new handoff session as permission to close a claimed session**

Claude picked up session A, then ran `spx session handoff` mid-work to create session B, then proposed archiving A because B existed. The queue state was treated as the permission source, not the completion of the reflection workflow.

How to avoid: The existence of any session — whether self-created or left by another context — never grants permission to archive a claimed session. Permission flows from the three claimed-session rules: the set grows only by user confirmation; closure writes one canonical continuation per independent thread; a quick-release shortcut exists only within a few turns of pickup. Pickup never archives.

**Failure 4: Claude asked the operator to choose without reviewing session evidence**

Claude loaded context, then asked the operator whether to continue, review artifacts, or take a different approach before classifying the session from claim verdicts, persisted artifacts, coordination notes, overlapping `doing` sessions, branch state, PR state, and expected verification. The operator had to choose from raw session metadata rather than an evaluated proposal.

How to avoid: Review the session evidence after `/contextualize`, classify the session, and present a no-surprises proposal before asking. The operator approves a represented course of work; if a new skill, evidence surface, external dependency, ownership conflict, or verification class appears later that the proposal did not represent, stop at the next safe checkpoint and present the delta.

**Failure 5: Claude tried to close a session whose work was owned elsewhere**

Claude picked up a duplicate session, saw evidence that another active `doing` session, branch, or PR already owned the objective, then drifted toward archive, release, or handoff because the workflow only modeled "wrongly claimed" as the current context's own session to close.

How to avoid: Classify the session as `owned_elsewhere`, report the owning session, branch, or PR, and stop without archiving, releasing, handing off, or moving any session.

**Failure 6: Claude treated assignee state as the complete Change claim**

Claude added the assignee and Claim comment, then began execution while the project Status remained Available or unset. The body also carried a prose Lifecycle value, creating two competing homes for the same fact.

How to avoid: Read Product, Maturity, and Status from the project item before mutation; require Available with no assignee; add the assignee; post the winning Claim; write Status `Claimed`; verify the complete state; then remove any legacy metadata line only after the project fields are settled.

<success_criteria>
Each bullet is tagged `(both)` when it holds under and without `spx/local/coordination.md`, or `(session file only)` when it belongs to the session-file path alone. Under the overlay a successful pickup satisfies `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/change.md`'s success criteria — Product and Maturity verified, Status `Claimed`, exactly one assignee, the earliest Claim after the latest Handoff belonging to this session, `<PICKUP_CLAIM change="...">` and a cumulative `<CLAIMED_CHANGES urls="...">` emitted, execution only from a validated Executable Change continuing at the Handoff's Next Activity, and a proposal that names the Frame's governing truth first — plus every `(both)` bullet. Without the overlay a successful pickup satisfies every bullet:

- [ ] (session file only) Session claimed via `spx session pickup`
- [ ] (session file only) Canonical pickup claim marker emitted as `<PICKUP_CLAIM id="...">`
- [ ] (session file only) Running CLAIMED_SESSIONS marker emitted as `<CLAIMED_SESSIONS ids="...">` including the newly claimed session id
- [ ] (session file only) Claimed session remains in `doing` after pickup — pickup never archives, releases, or moves any session, except the legacy-file archive `<change_coordination>` authorizes after its Change reaches a verified Claimed state
- [ ] (session file only) No new handoff session is treated as permission to archive, release, or replace a claimed session
- [ ] (both) `/understand` invoked immediately before the workflow's first product-content access — the coordination-note path check or the `/contextualize` invocation on the session-file path, the Change-body read on the Change path — and not before the claim, session presentation, checkout, base sync, or claim reconciliation
- [ ] (session file only) Session `next_step` presented only after `/sync-base` and claim reconciliation, and before node context or continuation work
- [ ] (both) Checkout brought current via `/sync-base` before any session detail is presented, for every `git_ref` kind
- [ ] (both) In a bare-repository worktree pool, the assigned worktree's running claim is verified read-only before the work branch is switched into it, with a missing claim surfaced via `/diagnose` — `spx worktree claim` is not run during pickup, and no other pool worktree is entered or created
- [ ] (session file only) Recorded claims reconciled by running `verify_session_claims.py`, with per-claim `Confirmed` / `Discrepancy` / `Unverifiable` verdicts presented in place of the recorded snapshot before the checkpoint
- [ ] (session file only) PLAN.md / ISSUES.md paths checked before context loading, with note content read by `/contextualize`
- [ ] (session file only) Persisted artifacts acknowledged
- [ ] (both) `/contextualize` invoked on target node — NOT offered as an option, just done
- [ ] (session file only) Session evidence reviewed after `/contextualize`: claim verdicts, persisted artifacts, loaded coordination notes, overlapping `doing` sessions, branch state, PR state, and expected verification
- [ ] (session file only) Session classified as `actionable_here`, `owned_elsewhere`, `stale_or_superseded`, `blocked_on_external_dependency`, or `needs_operator_direction`
- [ ] (both) When classification is `owned_elsewhere`, the owning session, branch, worktree, PR, or commit is reported and pickup stops without archiving, releasing, handing off, or otherwise mutating the claimed session
- [ ] (session file only) When classification is not `owned_elsewhere`, a no-surprises proposal with the same fields as the overlay's proposal above, minus the governing-truth field the Change supplies, is presented before any operator decision
- [ ] (both) Any later unrepresented skill, evidence surface, external dependency, ownership conflict, or verification class stops at a safe checkpoint before continuation
- [ ] (session file only) When the session references multiple nodes, the `/contextualize` target is selected deterministically by the priority order (rule 3 always resolves), so node multiplicity never triggers a user question — the user is asked which node only when `<nodes>` is empty or unreadable
- [ ] (session file only) When classification is not `owned_elsewhere`, canonical post-context marker emitted as `<PICKUP_CHECKPOINT id="..." claimed="...">` carrying the full claimed-session set from the most recent `<CLAIMED_SESSIONS>`
- [ ] (both) When classification is not `owned_elsewhere`, post-context decision captured via `AskUserQuestion` response, or explicit `--auto-continue` override acknowledged
- [ ] (both) No `/apply`, ADR, test, code, or file-editing work starts before the checkpoint or override
- [ ] (session file only) Failures listed in coordination are verified against current state before triaging
- [ ] (session file only) When classification is not `owned_elsewhere`, Claude has the session `next_step`, current claim verdicts, loaded node context, and coordination-note paths needed to choose the next skill from current methodology
