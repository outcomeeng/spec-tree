  ALWAYS invoke this skill when converting the decision citations of a 3.x Spec Tree product to the tree-absolute Markdown links the 4.0 methodology requires, or when `spx` rejects a decision cited as a code span, a bare path, or a node-local link. NEVER convert those citations by hand or by search and replace.

<objective>

Every decision citation in the product's `spx/` tree written as a Markdown link with a tree-absolute href, every `../`, leading-slash, out-of-node, and descendant-node link to a file in `spx/` carrying a tree-absolute href, and each citation the conversion cannot convert listed in a report and left unchanged. Text inside a fenced code block and a path carrying a template placeholder fall outside the conversion and the report.

</objective>

<workflow>

<step name="locate_root">

The product root is the directory that holds `spx/`. Resolve it from the repository:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

When that directory holds no `spx/`, report it and stop.

</step>

<step name="convert">

Run the conversion with the product root as its one parameter:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/convert_links.py" <product-root>
```

The conversion rewrites the Markdown files beneath `<product-root>/spx/`:

- A code span holding a decision path becomes a Markdown inline link whose text and href are the full path from `spx/`.
- A link to a decision record, including a decision of the citing node, gets the full path from `spx/` as its href; its text becomes that path only when its text was the path it replaces.
- A link to a file in `spx/` that climbs with `../`, leads with a slash, leaves its node, or reaches into a descendant node gets a tree-absolute href; its text stays. A link to a file outside `spx/`, and an assertion evidence link that would need a changed href, stay as written and are reported.
- A reference-style definition follows the rules of an inline link and stays a reference definition.
- Fenced code blocks stay untouched.

It prints one JSON document:

```text
{"schemaVersion": 1, "rewritten": [...], "unconvertible": [...]}
```

`rewritten` lists each changed file as a path from the product root. `unconvertible` lists each citation the conversion cannot convert, with its `file`, `line`, `form`, and `target`; the run continues past each one. Exit status 0 means no citation remains unconvertible. Exit status 3 means the report lists at least one, after the conversion rewrote every other citation.

Exit status 1 means the root holds no `spx/` or another error stopped the run, and the conversion may already have rewritten files before it stopped. Report the error message, which names the files already rewritten, report those files as a partial rewrite, and stop. Report any other exit status verbatim as an error and stop.

</step>

<step name="verify">

Run the same command a second time. Its `rewritten` list is empty and its exit status equals the first run's; report any difference as an error and stop.

</step>

<step name="report">

Present the complete report of the first run: the rewritten files, then every unconvertible citation with its file, line, form, and target. The form `text-decision` is a decision path written as bare prose or held in a code span beside other text; the form `broken` is a target that does not exist; the form `outside-tree` is a link to a file outside `spx/`, which no 4.0 link shape reaches; the form `evidence-link` is an assertion evidence link, a link whose text is `test`, `eval`, or `probe`, written inline or in the reference style, that leaves its node, which only moves the assertion or its evidence repairs. Leave each reported citation unchanged for the operator. After exit status 3, state that the operator resolves each reported citation and runs the conversion again.

</step>

<step name="review">

Show the working tree's changes; the files the conversion rewrote are the ones the first run's `rewritten` list names:

```bash
git status --short
```

</step>

</workflow>

<testing>

The conversion ran over fixture trees before release, with these recorded results:

- A tree holding every citation form — a code span, a link to a decision of the citing node, `../`, leading-slash, out-of-node and descendant-node links, a reference definition, and a fenced block — converts to the expected tree byte for byte, `rewritten` lists exactly the changed files, and the run exits 3 with the expected report.
- A tree whose citations all convert prints no report line and exits 0.
- A second run over a converted tree rewrites nothing and prints the same report.
- A root without `spx/` exits 1 and changes no file.
- A path with a template placeholder stays unchanged and unreported; a bare prose path and a decision path a code span holds beside other text each print as `text-decision` and stay unchanged, including a concrete path beside a placeholder path in one code span.
- A link to a file outside `spx/` prints as `outside-tree`, and an assertion evidence link that would need a changed href prints as `evidence-link`; both stay unchanged. An evidence use inside a fenced block names no label, so a definition with that label converts.

</testing>

<constraints>

- NEVER rewrite a reported citation by reading its surrounding prose or by guessing its target; the operator names the intended target.
- NEVER rename a directory or a spec file: directory suffixes and spec file names stay as they are.
- NEVER run the conversion on a directory other than the repository root.

</constraints>

<success_criteria>

- The first run exited 0 or 3 and printed its JSON document; any other exit status was reported verbatim and ended the run.
- The second run's `rewritten` list is empty and its exit status equals the first run's.
- Every rewritten file and every unconvertible citation, with its file, line, form, and target, appears in the presented report.
- Every citation the report lists as unconvertible stands unchanged in its file.
- A decision path the run leaves as text outside a link and a fenced block, and carrying no template placeholder, appears in the report as `text-decision` or `broken`, so a run that exits 0 leaves none; a link to a file outside `spx/` and an assertion evidence link that leaves its node appear as `outside-tree` and `evidence-link`.

</success_criteria>
