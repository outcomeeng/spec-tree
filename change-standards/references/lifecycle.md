This reference operationalizes the Lifecycle and Handoff rules of the Change chapter `change-record.md` names, for the store `spx/local/coordination.md` declares; it replaces nothing in the chapter. Lifecycle records who holds a Change or how it ended and moves independently of Maturity.

</scope>

<lifecycle_rules>

<rule id="store-binding">

Read `spx/local/coordination.md` for the Change store (`owner/repo`) and the Product value. The store is a GitHub repository whose owner is an organization that defines the issue fields `canonical-state` names; a store of another kind is a blocked operation naming the declared store. Read no other overlay for the store; a transition that moves the checkout reads `spx/local/merging.md` for the safety checks the repository declares around a detach. Every store command names only that store; a `gh` grant admits any repository the account reaches, so this discipline is the containment. An absent overlay is a blocked operation naming the missing file; no Lifecycle transition runs without a declared store.

</rule>

<rule id="canonical-state">

The issue holds each Change field in its one home: the issue title holds `title`; the organization issue fields `Product`, `Maturity`, and `Lifecycle` hold `product`, `maturity`, and `lifecycle`; the organization text issue field `Predecessors` holds `refined_from` as canonical identities such as `owner/repo#N`, separated by a comma and one space and empty for a root; native issue dependencies hold `blocked_by`; and the issue body holds the four sections with no front matter and no lineage line. Comments carry Claim, Handoff, and terminal records, and the assignee list represents the holder. No project field holds a Change field.

Read the issue with `gh issue view <N> --repo <store> --json number,title,state,stateReason,assignees,comments,url`. Read its fields with `gh api graphql -f query='query($o:String!,$r:String!,$n:Int!){repository(owner:$o,name:$r){issue(number:$n){id issueFieldValues(first:50){nodes{... on IssueFieldSingleSelectValue{name field{... on IssueFieldSingleSelect{name}}} ... on IssueFieldTextValue{value field{... on IssueFieldText{name}}}}}}}}' -f o=<owner> -f r=<repo> -F n=<N>`, selecting each value by its field `name`. `Product`, `Maturity`, and `Lifecycle` each carry exactly one value; an absent value is a missing required field. `Lifecycle` is valid only as `Available`, `Claimed`, `Applied`, `Refined`, or `Abandoned`; any other value is reported as unrecognized, with nothing written. Never derive a field from issue prose.

Write a single-select field with `gh api graphql -f query='mutation($i:ID!,$f:ID!,$v:ID!){setIssueFieldValue(input:{issueId:$i,issueFields:[{fieldId:$f,singleSelectOptionId:$v}]}){clientMutationId}}' -f i=<issue-id> -f f=<field-id> -f v=<option-id>`; the text field takes `textValue:$v` with `$v:String!` in place of the option. The issue id is the `id` the field read returns. Resolve the field and option ids with `gh api graphql -f query='query($l:String!){organization(login:$l){issueFields(first:50){nodes{... on IssueFieldSingleSelect{id name options{id name}} ... on IssueFieldText{id name}}}}}' -f l=<owner>`; hardcode none of them.

A Change's successors are the store records whose `Predecessors` value names its canonical identity `<store>#<N>`. Read every store issue's value with `gh api graphql --paginate -f query='query($o:String!,$r:String!,$endCursor:String){repository(owner:$o,name:$r){issues(first:100,after:$endCursor){pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor} nodes{number url issueFieldValues(first:50){nodes{... on IssueFieldTextValue{value field{... on IssueFieldText{name}}}}}}}}}' -f o=<owner> -f r=<repo>`, split each value at every comma followed by one space, and keep the records with an entry equal to `<store>#<N>`. A Change's blockers are its native dependencies, read with `gh api repos/<store>/issues/<N>/dependencies/blocked_by`.

</rule>

<rule id="ordered-write">

A transition records each successful write in its declared order. When a required command fails, a required field is absent, or a readback differs from the intended state, stop before every later mutation and report: the successful writes in order, the failed command or mismatched value, and the observed Product, Maturity, Lifecycle, assignees, issue state and reason, and newest `Claim:`, `Handoff:`, or terminal comment. Never repair a partial transition by guessing which later mutation would make it look complete.

</rule>

<rule id="complete-readback">

A transition completes only after re-reading the issue and its fields and finding every value equal to the intended state: Product equals the overlay Product, Maturity is unchanged, Lifecycle equals the target value, the assignee list equals the intended holder set, and the transition's own record is the one its rule selects: for a claim, the winning Claim under `claim-record` is the exact comment the transition posted; for a release or a close, the newest `Handoff:` or terminal comment is. Report the readback values verbatim.

</rule>

<rule id="write-inspection">

Before any write that sends text to the store — a comment, an issue title or body, or a text field value — inspect the exact text about to be written for secret values and credential payloads: tokens, keys, passwords, connection strings, cookies, or any pasted credential-shaped content. When any appears, write nothing, report only the kind of content found, never the value, and ask through the structured-question tool whether the operator supplies a redacted text or abandons the write; on redaction, inspect the supplied text and continue; on abandon, the write does not happen and the result says so.

</rule>

<rule id="inert-stdin">

Every field a `gh` command receives from a Change body, conversation state, or interview output is passed as inert data. Comments and bodies go on stdin as `--body-file -`: in an interactive session, a quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'` … `EOF`) so the text sees no expansion — confirm no body line equals the terminator, and choose another terminator when one does; in a programmatic runner that requires one physical line, `printf '%s\n' 'line' 'line' … | gh …` with each line one single-quoted argument. Every other interpolated argument is one single-quoted argument; inside it a literal apostrophe is written as `'"'"'` and nothing else is escaped. Never `--body "…"`, never a double-quoted argument carrying such text, never a scratch file, never a redirect built from it.

</rule>

<rule id="claim-record">

A Claim is one comment, `Claim: <agent session id> <claim root>`, posted after the assignee is added; the claim root is the worktree root the Change is claimed for — the claiming session's own assigned root, or a root it names. The Change's holder is the session whose assigned worktree root equals the claim root of the winning Claim. Holder exclusivity comes from the Claim, never from the assignee alone, because one account may run several sessions: the earliest `Claim:` posted after the newest `Handoff:` — or since issue creation when none exists — wins.

</rule>

<rule id="handoff-record">

A Handoff is one comment carrying exactly these lines and nothing that belongs in the body:

```markdown
Handoff:

- Branch or PR: <pushed work branch, or the PR URL, or `none`>
- Completed Activities: <checked items, by their text>
- Next Activity: <the first unchecked Activity, or `refinement: <Maturity> → <next level>` below Executable>
- Blockers: <blocking Change URLs still active, and each question the stopped work leaves for the operator, verbatim; or `none`>
- Hazards: <why the work stopped, and what the next holder cannot derive quickly — an unsealed run, a held checkout, a flaky check — each with the read-only command that re-confirms it>
```

Optional context lines after the five: the current agent session id and the assigned worktree root. The Handoff records what was true when it was posted; refinement of the Output belongs in the body, before the release.

</rule>

<rule id="terminal-record">

A terminal record is one comment whose text the terminal value fixes: `Application complete: changeset integrated, evidence satisfied, and Output delivered.` for `Applied`; `Refinement complete: all known successors exist.` for `Refined`, which requires at least one successor; `Abandoned: <the operator's stated reason>` for `Abandoned`. The close reason is `completed` for `Applied` and `Refined` and `not planned` for `Abandoned`. A terminal Change receives no Handoff and never returns to `Available`.

</rule>
