"""Command boundary for one change-record audit.

The runner reads one JSON request object on stdin, performs the requested file
or ``spx verification run`` operation from the repository root, and writes one
JSON result object on stdout. It writes no file: the SPX run journal is the only
state that persists between requests, and every request names the candidate
path and run token it acts on, so audits of different candidates started from
one worktree share nothing but the journal store SPX keys by run.

Every invocation writes exactly one result, and every result carries
``operation`` and ``status``. ``operation`` is the listed operation the request
names, or ``null`` when it names none. An ``ok`` result carries the operation's
values; a ``blocked`` result carries the reason, a detail line, and a run token:
the token of the run ``start`` created when ``start`` blocks after reading it,
otherwise the ``runToken`` string the request carries, otherwise
``not-started``. A failed command adds its exact command line, payload source,
payload key, exit code, and stderr. A filesystem, encoding, or decoding error
ends the request with a declared ``BlockReason``, never with a traceback.

``validate_request`` checks one parsed request completely before any process
starts: the field set ``REQUIRED_FIELDS`` declares for its operation, then each
field's form in the order ``_REQUEST_CHECKS`` lists. It raises ``Blocked`` with
``invalid-request``, or with ``path-rejected`` for a path that no filesystem
call can accept.

Tested with, each run observed for every file the runner process writes
anywhere and every process it starts:

- every operation of a complete rejected audit over a captured Change record;
- two such audits started at once from one worktree;
- a candidate edited before ``start``, and after it before ``reconcile``;
- a scope payload SPX rejects, which blocks with SPX's exit code and stderr;
- a request that is not UTF-8 text;
- a candidate that is absent, a directory, unreadable, linked outside the
  repository, or Windows-1252 text;
- for each operation that takes a ``runToken``, a request naming a started
  run with fields its operation does not take, which blocks with that
  operation and run token;
- generated request texts the runner cannot parse as one JSON object: a
  truncated request object, a JSON value of another type, or an object
  carrying an integer literal longer than the interpreter converts;
- generated request objects outside the request contract: an absent or
  unlisted operation; a missing field or one the operation does not take; a
  ``path``, ``candidateSha256``, ``runToken``, or ``terminalStatus`` that is
  not a non-empty string; a path, ``runToken``, or payload ``unitId`` carrying
  a NUL character or text with no UTF-8 encoding; an absolute,
  parent-traversing, or unnormalized candidate path; a payload that is not an
  object with a non-empty ``unitId``; a finding rule that is not a lowercase
  hyphenated ID; an ordinal that is not an integer from the minimum to the
  maximum; and an unlisted terminal status. Each blocks on stdout.

None of these writes a file outside the SPX store, and none starts a process
other than ``git`` and ``spx``; the generated requests start none.
