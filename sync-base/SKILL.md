<objective>
The current checkout brought current with its fetched base, with authorized dirty work that blocks base movement checkpointed on its owning branch and detached-head safety preserved.
</objective>

<workflow>

Record the absolute checkout root and selected base, then run the synchronization primitive against that working tree (default: the current directory). Retain the same checkout and base through checkpoint recovery and retry:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sync_base.py" [repo] [--base <branch>] [--no-fetch]
```

It resolves the base ref and `origin/<base>` through the shared changeset-scope primitives and fetches the base. When an attached branch is behind, it rebases the branch onto the fetched base. When a clean detached HEAD is an ancestor of the fetched base, it advances the worktree with `git switch --detach origin/<base>`; a detached HEAD carrying commits absent from the base fails without moving. The base defaults to `origin/HEAD`; pass `--base <branch>` when the changeset tracks a non-default base (a stacked pull request whose base is another feature branch). It prints a JSON result (`status`, `base_ref`, `remote_ref`, `branch`, `detail`, `preservation` on a clean outcome, and `conflict` on an active rebase conflict) and exits:

These statuses and exit codes belong to the primitive. Complete this workflow only after `already_current` or `rebased` establishes currency for the recorded checkout and base. A checkpoint alone establishes no currency, and a successful synchronization establishes neither working-tree cleanliness nor verification readiness. In particular, an already-current checkout may carry pending edits; those edits alone require no recovery checkpoint.

Resolve authorized `dirty_tree` state end to end through `<dirty_tree_resolution>`. The bundled synchronizer never commits or stashes; `/commit-changes` owns checkpoint policy, hooks, and proof of success. Use skill `spec-tree:commit-changes`. Create every recovery checkpoint through it, never through a direct `git commit`. Preserve the primitive result alongside any unresolved authority, checkpoint, Git, or conflict condition; a stopped recovery is no successful synchronization result.

Pass `--no-fetch` only when the remote-tracking ref is already current and a fetch would be redundant.

</workflow>

<dirty_tree_resolution>

A `dirty_tree` outcome means uncommitted tracked changes block base movement. Inspect the exact tracked paths, establish ownership, and apply existing authorization to those paths before mutation. Existing authorization remains effective within its stated scope until the operator changes it. An analysis or interview label neither grants nor revokes that authority and never waives an unfinished prerequisite. Stash remains forbidden.

1. **Authorized session-owned changes.** Classify changes Claude made during the active objective, respect explicit operator limits, and clear the precondition within the same invocation. Record the checked-out branch, or the full HEAD OID when detached, as the objective checkout. When objective paths and an unrelated note are dirty together, checkpoint the objective paths first:
   - **Related to the objective** → when the worktree is detached or sitting on the default branch, run `git switch -c work/<objective-slug>` from the current commit and record that branch as the objective checkout; invoke `/commit-changes` immediately on that branch, staging only the objective paths, regardless of whether verification is passing, failing, or not run.
   - **An unrelated coordination note** — a `PLAN.md` / `ISSUES.md` recording future work that is not part of the objective → once the note is the only remaining tracked change, run `git switch -c work/<note-slug> origin/<base>`, so the uncommitted note moves onto a branch cut from the fetched base, and commit it there through `/commit-changes`. Return with `git switch <objective-branch>`, or `git switch --detach <objective-head-oid>` when the objective checkout was detached, before the re-run in step 4. When `git switch -c` refuses because the note's path differs between the objective head and `origin/<base>`, stop with that blocked branch move and the note path. Name the note branch and its full head identity in the result as a separate changeset not yet on the default branch.
   - Every `git switch` in this step runs through the harness's per-call approval, as `<git_command_policy>` states.
2. **Operator-owned or unknown work.** When existing authorization covers committing the exact paths, invoke `/commit-changes` on their owning branch and continue. Otherwise preserve those files and their index state, report the blocked commit and exact paths, and request authority with a recommended commit option and a pause-and-inspect option. Apply the same boundary when an explicit operator limit withholds authority over session-owned paths. Never classify absent authority as a rebase conflict.
3. **Confirm the checkpoint.** Require `/commit-changes` to report a zero commit exit, changed full HEAD identity, committed and remaining paths, and verification state (`passing`, `failing`, or `not-run`). All three verification states permit preservation; later gates decide eligibility. A rejected hook, failed commit, unchanged HEAD, or incomplete result leaves recovery blocked. Preserve its exact diagnostics and repair through the owning workflow before retrying; never bypass hooks or infer success from a commit attempt.
4. **Re-run the primitive.** After a successful checkpoint, run `sync_base.py` again for the recorded checkout and base within the same invocation. Resolve any remaining authorized tracked changes through this recovery protocol. Finish only with `already_current` or `rebased`, or report the specific unresolved condition. Never report an intermediate authorized `dirty_tree` as completed synchronization.

</dirty_tree_resolution>

<conflict_reconciliation>

A `conflict` outcome means a rebase is active. Finish it. Never abort it without a decision, and never leave it waiting for someone to notice.

The superior is whoever assigned this work: the agent that gave the task, or the operator when no agent did. Reach an agent the way it reaches Claude, by mail or by a message into its session; reach the operator through the structured-question tool.

**Check the cost first.** `git status` names the commit the rebase stopped at and how many remain. Before reconciling, and again whenever a conflict resists, compare finishing the rebase with the cheapest alternative: cherry-picking only the commits that still matter onto `origin/<base>`, or redoing the change from `origin/<base>` using the old branch as reference. When an alternative takes clearly less work, stop and send the superior:

- where the rebase stands: the commit it stopped at, the commits still to replay, and the conflicts so far by kind;
- the suggested route and why it takes less work than finishing the rebase;
- what each route keeps and loses, and the branch or commit that keeps the old work reachable.

Leave the rebase active while the decision is pending. Then do what the superior decides: continue the rebase, or run `git rebase --abort` and take the route it chose.

**Otherwise, reconcile.** Read the `conflict` object, inspect the repository state, and reconcile every conflict that deterministic evidence can decide:

1. Inspect:
   - `git status`
   - `git diff`
   - `git ls-files -u`
   - `git show :1:<path>`, `git show :2:<path>`, and `git show :3:<path>` for conflicted paths when stage contents are needed.
2. Classify each conflicted path by portable role, never by repository-local path names:
   - **source of truth** — the project-declared authoritative source for a behavior or derived artifact.
   - **generated artifact** — a file produced from source by a project-declared regeneration command.
   - **coordination note** — `PLAN.md`, `ISSUES.md`, session notes, or the project's declared equivalents.
   - **governance surface** — specs, decisions, review policy, merge policy, or project-declared control files.
   - **ordinary implementation or test** — code or evidence governed by the loaded spec node and decisions.
3. Resolve autonomously when evidence decides:
   - Version or manifest bumps choose the monotonic/latest valid value, then include the exact project-declared version or manifest validation command in the result.
   - Generated artifacts are resolved by resolving their source of truth first. Never hand-merge generated output when regeneration is available. Include the exact project-declared regeneration command in the result and require re-entry after regeneration; this is a mechanical continuation, not an operator decision.
   - Redundant edits keep the change that supersedes the other by product truth, branch chronology, or source contract; remove the redundant text rather than preserving both.
   - Nearby independent edits are combined when both are compatible with the loaded specs, decisions, and tests.
   - Coordination notes are reconciled in place to still-true facts: keep every entry either side adds that remains true, and delete a stale, duplicate, or superseded entry from the resolved file.
4. After resolving a file, run `git add <resolved-paths>`.
5. Continue with `git rebase --continue`.
6. Return the resolved-path scope and the narrowest deterministic verification command the project's merge overlay, `spx/local/merging.md`, declares. Run that command through its governing workflow after the rebase completes; when the overlay cannot classify the paths, return the full deterministic gate command.

When a remaining conflict is a product-intent conflict — specs, decisions, tests, newer session state, and git facts do not choose which behavior should survive — ask the superior. The report says `Base sync stopped: rebase conflict requires reconciliation`, lists the conflicted paths, summarizes every reconciliation attempted, explains why evidence did not decide, gives the options from the `conflict.operator_options` list, and recommends one. Leave the rebase active while the decision is pending, then do what the superior decides.

Never end the work, release a Change, or hand off with a rebase active and no decision asked for. A rebase nobody owns stays in the worktree until someone finds it.

</conflict_reconciliation>

<git_command_policy>

Granted commands, which run without a per-call prompt:

- Read state: `git status`, `git rev-parse`, `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`, `git merge-base`, `git rev-list`, `git diff --name-only`, `git diff`, `git ls-files -u`, `git show :1:<path>`, `git show :2:<path>`, `git show :3:<path>`.
- Resolve: edit files, `git add <resolved-paths>`, `git rebase --continue`.
- Take the superior's decided route: `git rebase --abort`, run only on that decision under `<conflict_reconciliation>`.

Ungranted commands, which run through the harness's per-call approval because a prefix grant for them would also admit a form this policy forbids:

- Resolve one classified path: `git checkout --ours -- <path>` or `git checkout --theirs -- <path>`.
- Recover a dirty tree: `git switch -c work/<objective-slug>`, `git switch -c work/<note-slug> origin/<base>`, `git switch <objective-branch>`, and `git switch --detach <objective-head-oid>`, exactly as `<dirty_tree_resolution>` sequences them; the checkpoint commit itself goes through `/commit-changes`.
- Continue the superior's decided route after `git rebase --abort`: the cherry-pick or redo commands that route names, as `<conflict_reconciliation>` sequences them.

A per-call approval prompt is the harness's permission check on one command, never an operator question about the route; the route stays decided by evidence or by the superior.

The synchronizer script owns base movement. It runs `git fetch origin <base>` and either `git rebase origin/<base>` for an attached branch or `git switch --detach origin/<base>` for a clean detached HEAD that is an ancestor of the fetched base. Do not substitute direct sync commands for the script.

Explicitly disallowed:

- `git reset --hard`, `git reset --merge`, or any `git reset` as a base-sync mechanism.
- `git stash`.
- `git switch` with `-f`, `--force`, `--discard-changes`, `-C`, `--force-create`, or `-m`/`--merge`, and any `git switch` that moves the checkout away from uncommitted objective paths.
- `git checkout .` or `git restore .` to wipe conflict state.
- Blanket `git checkout --ours .` or `git checkout --theirs .`.
- Creating another worktree to escape the assigned one.
- `git rebase --abort`, unless the superior decided it under `<conflict_reconciliation>`.

Use `--ours` or `--theirs` only for a specific path after classification has already decided the product result. The checkout flag is the mechanical file update, never the decision.

</git_command_policy>

<readiness_preservation>

On `rebased` or `already_current`, the result carries a `preservation` object that identifies pre-push readiness work the base movement did not invalidate:

- `old_base_oid`, `new_base_oid`, `old_head_oid`, `new_head_oid` — full OIDs before and after the sync.
- `base_delta_paths` — the files the base advanced over.
- `branch_paths_before`, `branch_paths_after` — the branch's own changed paths against the old and new base.
- `path_overlap` — base-delta paths the branch also changed.
- `branch_patch_changed` — whether the branch's patch identity differs across the sync.
- `branch_diff_unchanged` — the git-only reuse signal: the branch patch is unchanged and the base delta does not overlap the branch.

Read `branch_diff_unchanged` to consider a prior local review reusable — and **also** confirm, against the project's merge overlay `spx/local/merging.md`, that no `base_delta_paths` entry is a governance surface the reviewer judges against. Run that overlay's narrowest deterministic lane covering `base_delta_paths`, falling back to the full gate when the overlay is absent, any path is unclassified, or `path_overlap` is non-empty. The proof carries no lane name — lane mapping is the overlay's.

The proof scopes pre-push local work only. It never satisfies a merge gate: current-head pull-request checks and the current-head CI review still decide `MERGE_READINESS` after the push.

</readiness_preservation>

<invariants>

- Rebase, never reset — a behind-base branch is brought current only by replaying its own commits onto `origin/<base>`.
- A routine rebase needs no new operator decision. Missing mutation authority, failed checkpoint creation, hard Git failure, and unresolved product intent retain their distinct blocked actions and evidence.
- A `dirty_tree` result is a precondition, never a conflict — tracked changes blocking base movement are resolved through `<dirty_tree_resolution>`, never by stashing and never surfaced as a conflict.
- Authorized session-owned tracked changes that block base movement are checkpointed on the owning branch and re-synced through `<dirty_tree_resolution>`; verification state alone never blocks the checkpoint.
- The bundled synchronizer fetches the base and, when movement is required, advances the current checkout through exactly one topology-appropriate operation: rebase for an attached branch, or `git switch --detach` for an ancestor detached HEAD. It never commits or stashes the working tree; the skill may create an owning branch and invoke `/commit-changes` to resolve a `dirty_tree` result before rerunning it.
- A conflicted rebase is finished, or handed to the superior with an assessment and a recommended route; Claude runs `git rebase --abort` only on the superior's decision and never stops with a rebase active and no decision asked for.
- One base derivation — the base ref and `origin/<base>` come from the changeset-scope primitives, never re-derived here.

</invariants>

<invalid_operator_escalations>

Apply the authority and checkpoint checks in `<dirty_tree_resolution>` before dirty-tree recovery. Report any remaining stop with its exact blocked action, paths, and evidence: absent authority identifies the missing permission; checkpoint failure carries the commit or hook diagnostic; hard Git failure carries `detail`; unresolved product intent carries the active conflict facts. Finish every independent authorized action before asking. Once authority is established and no checkpoint failure remains, none of the following alone warrants an operator question:

- A tracked edit Claude made this session that blocks base movement — commit it per `<dirty_tree_resolution>` and re-run.
- An unrelated tracked coordination note (`PLAN.md` / `ISSUES.md`) Claude edited that blocks base movement — commit it to its own branch, name that branch and its full head identity in the result as a separate changeset, and re-run.
- A conflict in a coordination note where one side is stale or superseded — reconcile the note to still-true facts and continue the rebase.
- A conflict in a generated artifact whose source of truth can be resolved — resolve the source, return the exact project-declared regeneration command, and continue after re-entry with regenerated output.
- A version bump conflict with an objectively monotonic/latest valid value — choose it, return the exact validation command, and run validation after the rebase completes.
- "Stash is forbidden, so the tree cannot be cleared" — committing clears it; the forbidden tool is not a blocker.
- A detached worktree with authorized tracked changes blocking base movement and no branch to commit onto — create a local branch from the current commit and commit there.
- Uncertainty about which branch a change belongs on — objective work goes on the change branch, an unrelated coordination note on its own branch cut from `origin/<base>`.
- A clean behind-base detached HEAD — sync-base advances it to the base tip; it returns `rebased` / `already_current`, not a stop.

Preserve each failure's classification through recovery. A decision about mutation authority cannot resolve a hook failure, and a successful commit cannot substitute for the primitive's currency result.

<failure_modes>

**Failure 1: Dirty-tree recovery stopped at an intermediate result.**

What happened: Claude returned session-owned `dirty_tree` before branch creation, commit authorization, and retry completed.

Why it failed: The public sync capability exposed an internal precondition instead of completing authorized recovery itself.

How to avoid: Keep `dirty_tree` as the bundled script's deterministic result, resolve authorized work through `/commit-changes` inside this workflow, and return only after rerunning the synchronizer.

**Failure 2: An interview label suspended an authorized prerequisite.**

What happened: Claude said base synchronization was paused during an interview even though existing authorization covered the checkpoint needed to continue.

Why it failed: A conversation label was treated as a change in authority, leaving the prerequisite unresolved.

How to avoid: Apply the operator's actual path-scoped authority and explicit limits, complete authorized recovery, and report any remaining blocked action with its evidence.

**Failure 3: A rebase was left for an operator who never came.**

What happened: Claude stopped a rebase of a long-lived branch at commit 2 of 21, reported the first conflict, and released its Change with the rebase still active. The worktree stayed blocked for sixteen days, the Change closed in the meantime, and its successor redid the work from the base anyway.

Why it failed: The stop waited for an operator to inspect it. Nobody owned it, and nobody weighed finishing the rebase against cherry-picking or redoing the change from the base.

How to avoid: Check the cost before reconciling, send the superior an assessment and a recommended route when another route takes less work, and act on its decision before ending the work.

</failure_modes>

<primitive_contract>

- Exit 0 carries `status=already_current` or `status=rebased`, `conflict=null`, and a non-null `preservation` object.
- After an attached-branch `rebased` outcome, `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<base> HEAD` succeeds and the branch's commits remain reachable from HEAD.
- After a detached-head `rebased` outcome, HEAD equals the full OID of the fetched `origin/<base>` tip.
- Exit 4 carries `status=dirty_tree` and `conflict=null`; HEAD, index, and tracked working-tree content match their pre-invocation state.
- Exit 3 carries `status=conflict`, a non-null `conflict` object with paths, git facts, conflict text, and operator options, and an active rebase state remains available for inspection.
- Exit 1 carries `status=git_failure` and a non-empty `detail`; a diverged detached HEAD remains at its original full OID.
- Every clean outcome's `preservation` object carries `schema_version`, full old/new base and head OIDs, base and branch path sets, overlap, and patch-identity booleans; it carries no project lane name.
- Git state and command output show no synchronization through `git reset`, no commit or stash created by the bundled synchronizer, and no automatic `git rebase --abort` at conflict handoff.
- Each result preserves the primitive's status and diagnostics; checkpoint recovery never invents additional primitive exit codes.

</primitive_contract>

<success_criteria>

- The final primitive result is `already_current` or `rebased` for the recorded checkout and selected base, with the full identities and preservation facts required by `<primitive_contract>`.
- Every recovery checkpoint carries `/commit-changes` proof of success and recorded verification state, and precedes a successful retry for that checkout and base.
- Existing path-scoped authority and explicit operator limits govern mutations independently of interview labels and verification state.
- An unresolved authority, checkpoint, Git, or product-intent condition reports the exact blocked action and evidence, with no claim of completed synchronization, clean working-tree state, or verification readiness.
