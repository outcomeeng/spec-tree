"""Bring a branch behind its fetched base current by rebasing.

Synchronization fetches the branch's base, detects whether the branch is
behind the remote-tracking base ref ``origin/<base>``, and rebases the
branch's own commits onto that ref. The mechanism is rebase, never
``git reset``: rebase replays the branch's commits onto the advanced base,
preserving the branch's work, where ``reset`` would repoint the branch while
leaving the working tree at the old base and silently revert merged changes.

A clean rebase runs without operator interaction. A rebase conflict leaves the
rebase state active so the caller can inspect and reconcile the conflicted
stages. When autonomous reconciliation cannot resolve it, the human-facing
report names the conflicted paths, the attempted sync, and the operator's
manual options, including continuing or aborting the rebase.

A working tree with uncommitted changes to tracked files blocks the rebase
before it starts. This is reported as the distinct ``dirty_tree`` outcome with
no rebase attempted and the working tree left untouched: a dirty tree is a
precondition the caller clears by committing through the commit workflow, not a
rebase conflict, and synchronization never commits or stashes on the caller's
behalf. Untracked files do not block a rebase and are not a dirty tree.

A detached HEAD — a worktree with no branch checked out, the normal parked state
of a bare-repository worktree pool — is brought current by fetch-and-compare
rather than waved through. When the detached commit is an ancestor of the
fetched ``origin/<base>`` (behind it or equal to it) and the working tree is
clean, the worktree is advanced to the base tip and reported ``rebased`` (it
moved) or ``already_current`` (it was already there); a behind detached commit
with uncommitted tracked changes reports ``dirty_tree``. When the detached
commit has diverged — it carries commits the base lacks — advancing it would
orphan those commits, so the outcome is ``git_failure``; a detached HEAD has no
branch to rebase its own commits onto. A detached HEAD with no resolvable remote
base also reports ``git_failure``. Advancing a clean, strictly-behind detached
worktree is a fast-forward to commits it does not yet have, never the reset the
mechanism rejects.

On a clean outcome (``rebased`` or ``already_current``) the result carries a
readiness-preservation proof: full before/after base and branch OIDs, the base
delta, the branch's changed paths against the old and new base, their overlap,
and whether the branch patch identity changed. A caller reads it to decide
which pre-push readiness predicates survive the base movement. The proof is git
facts only — validation-lane mapping and the governance-surface list are the
project overlay's — and it never satisfies a merge gate.

The base ref and its remote-tracking form are resolved through the shared
changeset-scope primitives, never re-derived here. The primitives ship under a
runtime-substituted plugin skill directory and are not importable by package
name, so they are loaded through ``importlib`` and re-exported with object
identity preserved. When that sibling script is absent or fails to load, the
script prints a ``git_failure`` result naming the expected path and exits 1.
